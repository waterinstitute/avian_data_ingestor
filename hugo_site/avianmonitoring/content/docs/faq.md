##	Q: Is the Nest category indicative of two birds/nest?
A: Yes. Estimating breeding population size, for example, will involve multiplying totals for all combined nest categories by 2.
##	Q: In some instances, Nest Totals are greater than Bird Totals. Why is this?
A: These instances usually involve having counted Chick Nests Without Adult; these nests get included in the Nest Total but not the Birds Total. This nest category is often used for brown pelican as well as great egret and other waders. Abandoned Nests and Broods similarly represent Nests without an attending adult. 
##	Q: Why is there a species listed in the photo legend that is not in the image?
A: This can occur when an analyst uses a saved file that includes a more comprehensive species list than that encountered in the photo being analyzed. This routine practice avoids the need to manually recreate a species list with each new image, thereby enhancing workflow.  
##	Q: Why is the symbol for different bird species not always the same in separate images?
A: Species and category symbols and colors vary in part due to a limited number of options available in the imaging software. They may also vary by analyst or dotting session, sometimes based on an effort to make the symbols stand out from varying background coloration. 
##	Q: Are nonbreeding birds counted in both May and June included in the dataset?
A: Usually no. Combining May and June nest counts typically involves a complete colony-wide count of breeders and nonbreeders from one month and only additional breeding groups from the other month. Regardless, Nest Count is the target metric for analysis.
##	Q: Why are there instances in which nests dotted with specific shapes are not reported the same in the corresponding legend?
A: More recent versions of the imaging software automatically convert all shapes on the annotated image to dots in the count window. 
##	Q: Why do some birds appear to not be dotted?
A: In many cases, undotted birds represent Chick Nests, where the adult is standing away from the chicks.  The dotting process involves placing the dot between them, which can make some birds appear undotted. In other cases, analysts chose not to dot roosting birds along shorelines due to time constraints.
##	Q: Why are some flying birds counted but others are not?
A: Normally, flying birds are not counted because they may not be associated with the breeding colony or, even if they are, could end up in another image. In rare instances, flying birds were counted if they were clearly associated with a breeding group. Such instances have involved birds flushed by the plane from the edge of a growing colony group and least terns at isolated colony sites.
